# LeetCodes - LeetCode Challenges -> My Solutions

Welcome to my personal repository for coding challenge solutions! This repository serves as a database of my solutions to various algorithmic and data structure problems, primarily from platforms like LeetCode. The main goal is to track my progress, improve my problem-solving skills, and maintain a historical record of my submitted solutions.

## Purpose

This repository is intended as a **public coding journal**, where I document my solutions to different coding challenges encountered in technical interviews and online coding platforms. Over time, I aim to observe my technical growth, refine my coding skills, and enhance my ability to solve problems efficiently.

## Rules for Submission

To maintain the integrity of my learning process and accurately assess my progress, I have set the following rules for submitting solutions:

- **No AI assistance for initial implementation:** I will develop all solutions entirely on my own before submission.
- **AI for post-submission analysis only:** After submitting my code to the platform, I may use AI to analyze and describe my approach, as well as to provide suggestions for optimization or alternative methods.
- **Focus on raw problem-solving ability:** The repository will showcase my current technical capabilities and how they evolve over time.

## Types of Challenges

The problems solved in this repository will primarily include:

- **Algorithmic challenges** (sorting, searching, recursion, etc.)
- **Data structure problems** (linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.)
- **Dynamic programming**
- **Mathematical and combinatorial problems**
- **System design problems (if applicable)**

## How to Use This Repository

Each solution will be stored in a structured manner, categorized by difficulty and topic. Each solution file will contain:

- The problem statement (if allowed by platform policies)
- My implementation
- A brief post-submission analysis with AI-generated insights (strategy breakdown and improvement suggestions)

## Why This Approach?

By enforcing a strict no-AI policy during development, I aim to continuously improve my logical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and algorithmic thinking without external influence. The AI's role will be purely to **describe my approach** and provide **feedback after submission**, ensuring a more natural learning curve.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for personal use, but if you find a mistake or want to discuss solutions, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion!

## License

This repository is open-source and available under the MIT License. Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt my solutions, but always strive to write your own implementations first!
